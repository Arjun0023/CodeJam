```spl
index=*  (eventtype=wineventlog_security OR eventtype=syslog)  (failure OR failed OR error)  (login OR authentication OR access)
| stats count by user, host
| search count > 10  //Adjust threshold as needed
```

**Explanation:**

*   `index=*`:  This searches across all indexes.  You should replace `*` with specific indexes relevant to your login attempts (e.g., `index=wineventlog, linux_logs`) for better performance and accuracy.
*   `(eventtype=wineventlog_security OR eventtype=syslog)`: This filters for events that are tagged as either Windows Security logs or Syslog messages, which are common sources of login information. Adjust if you are using other sources or event types.
*   `(failure OR failed OR error) (login OR authentication OR access)`: This looks for events containing keywords like \"failure\", \"failed\", or \"error\" in combination with \"login\", \"authentication\", or \"access\".  This helps narrow down to events related to login attempts.
*   `stats count by user, host`: This groups the events by `user` and `host` and counts the number of events for each unique combination. This is crucial to identify users or hosts with multiple failed attempts.  You might need to adjust the field names depending on your data (e.g., `src_user`, `dest_host`, `account_name`).
*   `search count > 10`: This filters the results to only show users or hosts that have more than 10 failed login attempts. Adjust the `10` to a threshold that makes sense for your environment.  A higher threshold reduces false positives, but might miss legitimate issues. A lower threshold will show more results, but will probably contain more noise.

**Refinements and Alternatives:**

1.  **Specific Event Codes (Windows Event Logs):**  For Windows event logs, you can target specific event codes associated with failed logins for more accuracy:

```splunk
index=wineventlog EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name, Computer
| search count > 10
```

Replace `Account_Name` and `Computer` with the correct field names from your Windows event logs if needed.  `EventCode=4625` is the standard failure code.

2.  **Syslog Examples (Linux/Unix):** Syslog messages vary greatly. Here are a few examples, which you'll likely need to customize:

    *   **SSH Failed Logins:**

```splunk
index=linux_logs host=* sourcetype=syslog \"Failed password for\"
| rex \"Failed password for invalid user (?<invalid_user>\\S+) from (?<src_ip>\\S+)\"
| stats count by invalid_user, src_ip
| search count > 5
```

    *   **Authentication Failures (General):**

```splunk
index=linux_logs sourcetype=syslog  \"authentication failure\" OR \"Authentication Failures\"
| stats count by user, host
| search count > 5
```

3.  **Focusing on \"Invalid User\" Attempts:**

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=syslog \"Invalid user\"  (login OR authentication)
| stats count by user, host
| search count > 5
```

4.  **Using `tstats` for Performance (If accelerated data models are configured):**  If you have accelerated data models for authentication or security events, `tstats` can be much faster:

```splunk
| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication.Failed_Logins by Authentication.user, Authentication.src
| search count > 10
```

Replace `Authentication.user` and `Authentication.src` with the correct fields from your data model.  You will need to enable the Authentication data model.

5.  **Timechart Visualization:**  To visualize failed login attempts over time:

```splunk
index=*  (eventtype=wineventlog_security OR eventtype=syslog)  (failure OR failed OR error)  (login OR authentication OR access)
| timechart count span=1h  // Replace span with your desired interval (e.g., 15m, 1d)
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Sources:**  The most important thing is to identify the correct data sources (indexes and sourcetypes) that contain your login attempt logs.
*   **Field Names:**  Field names like `user`, `host`, `Account_Name`, `Computer`, `src_ip` will vary depending on your logs. Inspect your logs to determine the correct field names.  Use the `rex` command or field extractions to create consistent fields if necessary.
*   **Threshold:** The threshold (`count > 10`, `count > 5`) for identifying suspicious activity is crucial.  Start with a higher threshold and gradually lower it while monitoring for false positives.  Consider different thresholds for different users or hosts.
*   **User Enumeration:** Be aware that simply counting failed login attempts may not catch sophisticated attacks like user enumeration, where attackers try many different usernames to find valid accounts. Consider correlating failed logins with successful logins.
*   **Correlation:**  Correlate failed login attempts with other security events (e.g., malware detections, network traffic anomalies) for a more comprehensive view of potential threats.
*   **Alerting:** Once you have a query that accurately identifies failed login attempts, create an alert in Splunk to notify you when the threshold is exceeded.

Before deploying any of these queries, test them on a small sample of your data to ensure they are working correctly and not generating false positives.  Adapt the queries to your specific environment and logging configurations.

**Splunk CIM Authentication Schema:**

The Common Information Model (CIM) normalizes field names across different data sources to enable consistent searching:

*   **Key CIM Authentication Fields:**
    * `action`: Values like "success", "failure" for login attempts
    * `app`: The application being accessed
    * `src`: Source address of the authentication attempt
    * `dest`: Destination address where authentication occurred
    * `user`: Username attempting authentication
    * `src_user`: Source username for the connection
    * `dest_user`: Destination username being accessed
    * `signature`: Description of the authentication event
    * `status`: Status of the authentication attempt (success/failure)
    * `duration`: Duration of the session

*   **CIM-Based Authentication Monitoring Examples:**

```splunk
| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.action=failure by Authentication.src Authentication.user Authentication.app
| rename Authentication.src as Source Authentication.user as Username Authentication.app as Application
| search count > 10
```

```splunk
| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.action=failure by Authentication.src Authentication.user Authentication.app Authentication.dest
| where count > threshold
| `get_asset_info(Authentication.dest)`
| `risk_score_authentication(Authentication.src, Authentication.user)`
```

**Okta Schema and Examples:**

*   **Key Okta Fields:**
    * `actor.displayName`: Username attempting authentication
    * `actor.alternateId`: Email of the user
    * `client.ipAddress`: Source IP address
    * `client.userAgent.rawUserAgent`: Browser/client making the request
    * `client.geographicalContext`: Location information
    * `outcome.result`: Success/failure status (SUCCESS, FAILURE, etc.)
    * `outcome.reason`: Reason for failure (INVALID_CREDENTIALS, etc.)
    * `eventType`: Type of authentication event (user.authentication.*)
    * `debugContext.debugData.requestUri`: URI being accessed
    * `debugContext.debugData.authenticationContext`: Authentication context details

*   **Okta-Specific Examples:**

```splunk
index=okta sourcetype=okta:events eventType="user.authentication.*" outcome.result="FAILURE"
| stats count by actor.alternateId, client.ipAddress, outcome.reason
| where count > 10
```

```splunk
index=okta sourcetype=okta:events eventType="user.authentication.*"
| stats count values(client.geographicalContext.country) as countries values(client.geographicalContext.city) as cities by actor.alternateId
| where mvcount(countries) > 1 OR mvcount(cities) > 3
```

*   **Okta with CIM Integration:**

```splunk
index=okta sourcetype=okta:events eventType="user.authentication.*"
| eval action=if(outcome.result=="SUCCESS","success","failure")
| eval user=actor.alternateId
| eval src=client.ipAddress
| eval app="Okta"
| eval signature=eventType
| eval status=outcome.result
| table _time user src action app signature status
| where action="failure"
| stats count by user, src
| where count > 5
```

*   **Combined Authentication Monitoring (Windows, Linux, Okta):**

```splunk
(index=wineventlog EventCode=4625) OR 
(index=linux_logs sourcetype=syslog "Failed password for") OR
(index=okta sourcetype=okta:events outcome.result="FAILURE")
| eval user=case(
    sourcetype=="okta:events", actor.alternateId,
    sourcetype=="WinEventLog:Security", Account_Name,
    sourcetype=="syslog", field("user"),
    1==1, "unknown")
| eval src=case(
    sourcetype=="okta:events", client.ipAddress,
    sourcetype=="WinEventLog:Security", Source_Network_Address,
    sourcetype=="syslog", field("src_ip"),
    1==1, "unknown")
| stats count by user, src, sourcetype
| where count > threshold
```

*   **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring:**

```splunk
| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication where Authentication.action=failure by Authentication.src Authentication.user
| join Authentication.src type=left [
    | tstats count as firewall_blocks from datamodel=Network_Traffic where Network_Traffic.action=blocked by Network_Traffic.src
]
| join Authentication.user type=left [
    | tstats count as previous_incidents from datamodel=Risk where Risk.risk_object_type=user by Risk.risk_object
    | rename Risk.risk_object as Authentication.user
]
| eval risk_score = case(
    count > 20, 50,
    count > 10, 30,
    count > 5, 10,
    1=1, 0)
| eval risk_score = risk_score + if(firewall_blocks > 0, 20, 0)
| eval risk_score = risk_score + if(previous_incidents > 0, 30, 0)
| where risk_score > 30
```
